	<h1>Halo Wars 2</h1>
		<h2>Története</h2>
			<p>Halo Wars 2 takes place in the science fiction universe of the Halo series, during the 26th century. The game is set in 2559, 28 years after the events of Halo Wars and shortly after the events of Halo 5: Guardians. Halo Wars closes with the crew of the UNSC warship Spirit of Fire entering cryosleep and drifting into space. Since that event, the war between humanity and the military alien alliance known as the Covenant has ended, and the Spirit of Fire has been declared lost with all hands.[4] While the Spirit of Fire is adrift in space, the ship's artificial intelligence (AI) Serina (Courtenay Taylor) terminates herself before succumbing to rampancy, a terminal state. Captain James Cutter (Gideon Emery), Professor Anders (Faye Kingslee) and the crew aboard Spirit of Fire wake from cryosleep at the Ark, a Forerunner installation that manufactured the Halo rings. Isabel (Erika Soto) is a UNSC logistics AI operating at a research facility on the Ark when an alien faction known as the Banished invades the installation.[16] The Banished are led by the Brute warlord Atriox (John DiMaggio) and rose to power following the Covenant's demise Serving under Atriox are the Brute general Decimus and the Elite Shipmaster Let 'Volir (Darin De Paul) who reluctantly sided with the Banished in exchange for fuel for his ship and crew. </p>
		<h2>A játék cselekménye</h2>
			<p>The Spirit of Fire's crew awakens from cryosleep at the Ark and receives a UNSC signal from the surface of the installation. Spartan Red Team is deployed to investigate the signal. They recover Isabel from a base but during the exfiltration, Spartan Douglas-042 is injured in an engagement with Atriox and Spartan Alice-130 is left stranded on the Ark. Back on the Spirit of Fire, Isabel reveals to Captain Cutter how Atriox and the Banished invaded the Ark, which leads Cutter to declare war on the Banished. A strike team manages to set up a forward base and defeat Decimus, who is salvaging the Ark’s resources. Decimus escapes and orders a bombardment upon his own base. Upon investigating the wreckage, Isabel discovers information about the Cartographer, a map of key systems and weapons upon the Ark. The team secures a Forerunner elevator and ascends to the Cartographer.
				Meanwhile, Alice-130 contacts the Spirit of Fire and escapes the Ark with numerous recovered UNSC prisoners. The team, including Professor Anders, reaches the Cartographer’s map room despite being attacked by autonomous machines (Sentinels) that maintain the Ark. There, she discovers that Atriox has hijacked the Ark’s portal network, allowing him to transport troops across the whole structure. While trying to shut down the portal network, the team face Decimus again and defeats him for the second and final time. The Spirit of Fire then comes under attack from a Banished carrier ship. Professor Anders suggests that they create a Halo ring using the Ark’s protocols to transport the crew away from the Ark and back into UNSC-controlled space. The attacking carrier is destroyed when Isabel and Spartan Jerome-092 hijack its weapon systems to prompt the Sentinels stationed on the Ark to shatter it in two.
				The Spirit of Fire releases the new Halo, but faces immediate resistance upon it from the Banished. Back on the Ark, Alice-130 and Douglas-042 destroy enemy barricades and prevent reinforcements, including Atriox, from reaching the Halo; they then use the portal network to reach the Halo themselves. There, Professor Anders is escorted to the ring’s control room, where the firing system of the structure is deactivated and a signal beacon is set. Meanwhile, the Spirit of Fire's forces are locked in a struggle with the remnants of the Banished. Anders finds the gravity controls for the Halo and uses them to raise the land that the remaining Banished are standing on into space where it disintegrates. The ground forces return to the Spirit of Fire, but Anders and the Halo enter slipspace as they cannot halt the jump's countdown. Before the Halo jumps, Anders promises to get help from the UNSC as soon as possible. On the Ark, Atriox and a legion of Banished still live, preparing for the next fight against the UNSC. Meanwhile, the Halo carrying Anders drops out of slipspace prematurely, only to encounter a Foreunner construct known as a Guardian.
